<h1>The Interactive Ewald Sphere 3D Tutorial</h1>
<p><i>By Katie Tlusty, Paul Bond, K Cowtan</i></p>

<p>
Welcome to the 3D Ewald sphere tutorial! The aim of this tutorial is
to learn about the Ewald sphere, and how it explains X-ray diffraction patterns.
The tutorial uses an interactive tool, the 'Ewald sphere 3D applet'.
It builds on concepts from the 2D Ewald sphere tutorial.
</p>

<p>
This tool is designed to support learning as part of a formal taught course in X-ray crystallography, and is provided here so that anyone can incorporate it in their teaching materials. It was not designed for self-directed learning, but may be useful as a reinforcement activity in some cases.
